      <h3>01. about me</h3>
      <p>
        I am a third year university student studying applied math and computer engineering, and will be completing a 16 month work term from May 2020 - August 2021. My primary interests are in developing backend systems, specifically API planning and development, and general system design. I love tackling problems from a holistic perspective and enjoy working from frontend to backend. I hope to eventually develop software which makes medical care more accessible and affordable to people who would not normally have access to it.
