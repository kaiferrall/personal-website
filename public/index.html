          Hi there,
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a 4th year applied mathematics and computer engineering student looking for full time roles in software engineering.
          My areas of interest are distributed systems and IOT systems. I have extensive experience developing such applications with Google Cloud
          and AWS. I am also interested in full stack development as I enjoy working holistically on applications, and love developing great frontend
          user experiences.

            In a team of 3 this project was created for a hackathon. The system invloved a web cam streaming

            of the model was then streamed back to the client and displayed in the browser.
